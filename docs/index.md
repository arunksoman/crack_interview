# Welcome to Crack Interview

Hey, this website is to tackle the interview questions. Even though it will be a question and answer kind of website, I'm planning deep dive to concepts with illustrations and necessary code in order to walk you through all the necessary skills you wanted to achieve.

In order to understand contents on this website, you should know atleast one programming language. In this website we will add interview questions and answers for multiple programming languages like Python, Go, JavaScript, SQL etc. But we will start with Python first. Slowly we will contents for other programming languages also.

## Sincere Thanks

I'm not interested write a theme for this website. This website is completely built with  [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). So I owe sincere thanks to Martin Donath AKA [squidfunc](https://github.com/squidfunk) to fill such great features on mkdocs
